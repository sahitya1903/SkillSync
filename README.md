## 🔍 Problem It Solves

Recruiters use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes based on keywords. Most resumes never make it to a human.

**SkillSync solves this by:**
- Parsing your resume and job description
- Extracting and comparing key skills
- Showing a match score and what's missing
- Recommending personalized skill improvements
